# steam-api-wrapper-ts

This is a wrapper for the steam api written in typescript.
The project is based on (steam-api-ts)[https://github.com/JarivdKaap/steam-api-ts] and (node-steamapi)[https://github.com/xDimGG/node-steamapi].

**This library is still in very early development so I would not advice using it.**
